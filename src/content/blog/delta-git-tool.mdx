If you are using _git_ and you are using it on the terminal, here is a quick tip to potentially make your life easier. Have a look at this diff:

![Some of my notes about working with GIT](/images/gnu-parallel-delta.webp)

If that is what you want, you can install [delta](https://dandavison.github.io/delta/side-by-side-view.html), a helper for git that functions diff filter. Installation works via package manager like brew or pacman or choco and more, or you can just download the pre-built binary from GitHub. If installed, you need to instruct git to use it by updating your _.gitconfig_ in your home folder:

```
[core]
    pager = delta
[interactive]
    diffFilter = delta --color-only
[delta]
    navigate = true    # use n and N to move between diff sections
    light = false      # set to true if you're in a terminal w/ a light background color (e.g. the default macOS terminal)
[merge]
    conflictstyle = diff3
[diff]
    colorMoved = default
```

And this is technically it. Additionally, _delta_ provides a lot of features that you can configure. Check out the documentation or give mine a try:

```
[core]
    pager = delta
[interactive]
    diffFilter = delta --color-only
[delta]
    navigate = true    # use n and N to move between diff sections
    light = false      # set to true if you're in a terminal w/ a light background color (e.g. the default macOS terminal)
    features = unobtrusive-line-numbers decoration side-by-side diff-highlight diff-so-fancy
    whitespace-error-style = 22 reverse
[delta "unobtrusive-line-numbers"]
    line-numbers = true
    line-numbers-minus-style = "#444444"
    line-numbers-zero-style = "#444444"
    line-numbers-plus-style = "#444444"
    line-numbers-left-format = "{nm:>4}┊"
    line-numbers-right-format = "{np:>4}│"
    line-numbers-left-style = blue
    line-numbers-right-style = blue
[delta "decorations"]
    commit-decoration-style = bold yellow box ul
    file-style = bold yellow ul
    file-decoration-style = none
    hunk-header-decoration-style = yellow box
[merge]
    conflictstyle = diff3
[diff]
    colorMoved = default
```

With this, you might enjoy using git even more!
